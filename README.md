# Third Iteration of my portfolio website

Built strictly off Next.JS, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS, with the focus of mobile-first design as well as responsiveness and performance. Showcases experience, projects, contact methods, selected skills, and my full resume.

# Looking to run it locally and test out your own iterations?
Run the following in your IDE Terminal.
Dependencies: emailjs-com, fa icons (bold, brand, and regular), autoprefixer, next, react, react-dom, tailwindcss-filters (depreciated), and preprocessor.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bgar324/BenjaminGarcia-v3.git
cd BenjaminGarcia-v3
npm install
npm run dev
```
